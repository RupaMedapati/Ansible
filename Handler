Handlers in Ansible can also be used to manage services when copying files or making configuration changes. Below is an example of an Ansible playbook that copies a file to an Ubuntu image 
and uses a handler to restart the Apache service if the file is modified.
---
- name: Install Apache and Update Index.html with Handler
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update APT package cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

    - name: Install Apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
      notify: Restart Apache

    - name: Ensure the document root directory exists
      file:
        path: /var/www/html
        state: directory

    - name: Copy index.html file
      copy:
        src: /home/ubuntu/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
      notify: Restart Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Restart Apache
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
